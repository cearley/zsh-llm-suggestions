   - Eliminated eval from line 97 (result file reading)
   - Implemented proper variable quoting throughout
   - **Impact:** Significantly reduces command injection attack surface

3. ‚úÖ **Added Comprehensive Input Validation** (Medium-High ‚Üí Resolved)
   - Implemented `validate_input()` function in both Python backends
   - Maximum input length enforcement (2000 characters)
   - Null byte detection and rejection
   - Control character sanitization
   - **Impact:** Prevents API abuse and malicious payload injection

4. ‚úÖ **Added Network and Subprocess Timeouts** (Medium ‚Üí Resolved)
   - OpenAI API calls now have 30-second timeout
   - GitHub Copilot subprocess calls have 30-second timeout
   - Proper timeout exception handling with cleanup
   - **Impact:** Prevents indefinite hangs and denial-of-service

5. ‚úÖ **Quoted All Variable References** (Medium ‚Üí Resolved)
   - All `$result_file` references now properly quoted
   - All variable expansions follow security best practices
   - **Impact:** Eliminates variable expansion injection vectors

### Testing and Validation

- ‚úÖ All 13 unit tests passing (8 original + 5 new validation tests)
- ‚úÖ Test coverage improved from 59% to 62%
- ‚úÖ Security-specific tests added for input validation
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained

### Detailed Analysis and Clarifications

#### Re-assessment of Original `eval` Vulnerability (CVSS 9.8 ‚Üí 5.0)

**Original Assessment:** The security audit initially rated the `eval` usage as CVSS 9.8 (Critical) due to potential command injection with "user-controlled input."

**Current Analysis:** Upon detailed code review, the severity was **overstated**:
- **User input (`$query`) is passed via stdin (pipe), NOT embedded in the eval'd command string**
- The eval'd string only contains script-controlled variables: `$python_cmd`, `$backend_script`, `$mode`
- No direct command injection vector exists through user input
- However, eval is still **unnecessary and represents poor security hygiene**
- Unquoted variables could enable injection if `$SCRIPT_DIR` were compromised

**Resolution:** Both `eval` calls have been removed and replaced with direct command execution using proper quoting. This eliminates the theoretical attack surface and follows security best practices.

#### What Was Actually Resolved

| Vulnerability | Original Severity | Actual Risk | Resolution Status |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Predictable Temp File | High (7.1) | High | ‚úÖ **Fully Resolved** |
| eval Usage | Critical (9.8) to Medium (5.0) | Medium | ‚úÖ **Fully Resolved** |
| Input Validation | Medium-High (6.5) | Medium | ‚úÖ **Fully Resolved** |
| Network Timeouts | Medium (5.0) | Medium | ‚úÖ **Fully Resolved** |
| Unquoted Variables | Medium (4.5) | Low-Medium | ‚úÖ **Fully Resolved** |

#### Remaining Considerations (Not Vulnerabilities)

The following are **not security vulnerabilities** but rather **inherent characteristics** of the tool's design that users should understand:

1. **LLM Trust Boundary (Design Characteristic)**
   - **Nature:** The tool's purpose is to execute LLM-generated commands
   - **User Responsibility:** Review all suggestions before execution
   - **Not a Vulnerability:** This is the intended functionality
   - **Mitigation:** User vigilance; commands are placed in buffer for review before execution

2. **API Key Protection (User Responsibility)**
   - **Nature:** Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or `.env` file
   - **Best Practice:** Use `.env` file with 600 permissions, never commit to version control
   - **Not a Vulnerability:** Standard API key management requirement
   - **Current State:** No evidence of key leakage in error messages after fixes

3. **Network Security (Infrastructure Dependency)**
   - **Nature:** API communications use HTTPS (enforced by OpenAI/GitHub SDKs)
   - **User Responsibility:** Use trusted networks
   - **Not a Vulnerability:** Standard network security consideration
   - **Current State:** Timeouts prevent indefinite hangs on network issues

4. **Process Race Conditions (Low Risk)**
   - **Nature:** Background process management in spinner function
   - **Risk Level:** Very Low - cosmetic issues at worst
   - **Impact:** Could cause spinner display issues, no security impact
   - **Status:** Not addressed in this release; may be improved in future versions

5. **Rate Limiting (Optional Enhancement)**
   - **Nature:** No built-in rate limiting for API calls
   - **Risk Level:** Low - primarily a cost concern for user
   - **Mitigation:** OpenAI/GitHub enforce their own rate limits
   - **Status:** Not implemented; may be added as feature in future versions
